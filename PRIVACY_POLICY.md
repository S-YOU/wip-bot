# Privacy Policy

Gregor Martynus built the WIP app as an Open Source GitHub App. This service is provided by Gregor Martynus and is intended for use as is.

This page is used to inform users regarding my policies with the collection, use, and disclosure of Personal Information if anyone decided to use this service.

If you choose to use my Service, then you agree to the collection and use of information in relation to this policy. The Information that I collect is required for the service to work. It is neither stored nor shared with 3rd parties.

## Information Collection and Use

When installing the WIP app, GitHub shows all information that is accessible to the app. It includes but is not limited to

- Repository Name

None of the information is stored or shared with third party services, with the exception of [Zeit’s now](https://zeit.co/now) where the app is hosted. The information above maybe be stored in log files temporarily for debug purpose.

## Security

I value your trust in providing us your Personal Information, thus we are striving to use commercially acceptable means of protecting it. But remember that no method of transmission over the internet, or method of electronic storage is 100% secure and reliable, and I cannot guarantee its absolute security.

## Children’s Privacy

These Services do not address anyone under the age of 13. I do not knowingly collect personally identifiable information from children under 13. In the case I discover that a child under 13 has provided me with personal information, I immediately delete this from our servers. If you are a parent or guardian and you are aware that your child has provided us with personal information, please contact me so that I will be able to do necessary actions.
